Description: QOprCraft navigates through the subalgebras of mainly unitary matrices.
        Via decomposing files into beam splitters and shifters, theoretically desired matrices can be implemented (Selements()), as well as their quantum evolution (read: influence) given a number of photons (StoU()).
        The reverse operation: giving a desired evolution for finding the original matrix, is also true (SfromU()).
        For unavailable implementations, the option to obtain its closest, possible evolution matrix is also given via Toponogov().
        Systems with loss are treated by the fifth function QuasiU().
        A matrix generator, a test of some algorithms and every logarithm developed are also included as individual functions.
